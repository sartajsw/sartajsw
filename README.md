### Hi there 👋

I'm Sartaj and I'm a Master's Student at CMU ECE. My main areas of interest are Computer Architecture, Digital Design and Embedded Systems.

I joined grad school with the plan to focus on System Software and Digital Design but the coursework here has blown my mind and added Computer Architecture to my list. No matter how much I learn, I will always be in awe of how complex the systems that we interact with everyday are.

### I'm actively looking for Summer 2022 Internships

Cool stuff I'm working on right now:
- 🤖 Tapeout of a low power edge AI accelerator
- 🌐 Project on offloading datacenter tax
- 🧠 Neuromorphic computing
- 💻 RISC V simulator in C++

Here are some fun facts about me:
- 🔭 I'm an avid learner 
- 📚 I enjoy reading.
- 🏀 I play basketball
- 🎸 I play guitar
